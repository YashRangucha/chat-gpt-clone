# ChatGPT Clone 🤖 | AI Chat Interface with OpenAI API

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional clone of ChatGPT that allows users to interact with an AI language model via a conversational interface. It mimics the experience of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, enabling natural language interaction through a streamlined React-based frontend. The core functionality is powered by OpenAI’s GPT API, delivering intelligent, context-aware responses based on user input.

## 🚀 Key Technical Highlights

- **Frontend Framework**: Built using React.js for a fast and component-based UI.
- **AI Integration**: Connects to OpenAI's GPT API to generate dynamic, intelligent replies.
- **Async Request Handling**: Uses Axios to manage user prompts and receive responses.
- **Chat History**: Displays ongoing conversation in a chat-like format with timestamps.
- **Environment Config**: Uses `.env` for secure API key handling.
- **Responsive Layout**: Styled with modern CSS to ensure clean and mobile-friendly design.
